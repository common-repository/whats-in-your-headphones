Tell the world what you’re listening to.

== Description ==

This is a Wordpress plugin that allows users of your blog to tell eachother what music/podcast they're listening to via a Dashboard widget, and to provide a link to said music. The same information can be displayed on the front end in a widget.

= How it works =

Upload the plugin to your Wordpress plugin directory and activate it.

The Dashboard widget is automatically displayed to all users, and includes a link inviting user's to share what they're listening to. Users can edit their current song/artist of choice on their edit profile page, and can provide a link so other's can check out what they're listening to.

The plugin also includes a widget that can be displayed on to the public if the theme includes widget functionality. The widget has options to set the title, and whether or not to display users' names along with their music.

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. The Dashboard widget is activated automatically.
